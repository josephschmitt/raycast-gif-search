# GIF Search

This extension searches for animated GIFs from the internet (currently using giphy.com to search, with support for tenor.com coming soon). In order to use any of the GIF search API's, you'll have to sign up for a free developer account and obtain an API key. You'll be asked to supply that API key when first loading up the GIF Search extension.

You can sign up for a free developer account for Giphy at https://developers.giphy.com.
